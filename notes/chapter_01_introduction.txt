- Why Machine Learning Pipelines?
    -- Ability to Focus on New Models, Not maintaining existing models
    -- Prevention of Bugs
    -- Useful Paper Trail
    -- Standardization
    -- The business case for pipelines
        --- Reduced costs of data sicence projects
        --- Help detect potential biases in the datasets or in the trained
            models
        --- Create a paper trail to assist if questions arise around data
            protection laws
        --- free up development time for data scientists
- ML Pipelines are only useful when there are key users of a model.
    -- Experiments, paper reproduction, model architecture investigation are
        not good reasons to have an ML Pipeline
- Model Life Cycle
    -- Data Validation
        --- Common data validation tools will also allow you to compare
            different datasets
    -- Data Preprocessing
        --- It's important that modifications of preprocessing steps can be
            linked to the processed data and vice versa.
        --- This means if someone modifies a processing sttep, the previous
            training data should become invalid and force an update of the
            entire pipeline.
    -- Model Analysis
        --- Automation will keep the analysis of the models consistent and
            comparable against other analyses
    -- Model Deployment
        --- Modern model servers allow you to deploy your models without writing
            web app code
        --- Model servers also allow you to update a model version without
            redeploying your model application, which reduces application
            downtime and reduce communication between the application
            development and the machine learning teams
    -- Data Privacy
        --- Eventually, privacy-preserving methods will be integrated into tools
            for building machine learning pipelines
        --- Federated Learning: raw data does not leave a user's device
        --- Encrypted machine learning: entire training process can run in the
            encrypted space or a model trained on raw data can be encrypted
